Using the API
=============

In addition to :doc:`the pyinfra CLI <../cli>`, pyinfra provides a full Python API. As of ``v3`` this API can be considered mostly stable. See the :doc:`./reference`.

`An example of how to use the API can be found here <https://github.com/pyinfra-dev/pyinfra-examples/blob/main/.old/api_deploy.py>`_. Note: this is not yet tested and pending future updates.
